# Contributing to SYRA Protocol

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SYRA Protocol.

SYRA is a rule-based protocol designed to operate deterministically
and transparently. All contributions must strictly adhere to
the canonical protocol documentation.

---

## Guiding Principles

- Do not introduce behavior not specified in documentation
- Avoid assumptions, heuristics, or subjective logic
- Maintain deterministic execution at all times
- Preserve protocol clarity over implementation convenience

---

## Documentation First

All protocol behavior is defined in the SYRA Documentation:

https://syra.io/docs

If a proposed change is not explicitly described in the documentation,
it must not be implemented.

Documentation updates must precede implementation changes.

---

## Scope of Contributions

Appropriate contributions include:
- Implementation of documented protocol logic
- Refactoring for clarity without behavior change
- Test coverage for documented behavior
- Documentation alignment and corrections

Out of scope contributions include:
- Trading strategies or optimization logic
- Profit modeling or economic speculation
- Governance mechanisms not defined in documentation
- User interface components

---

## Pull Request Requirements

All pull requests must:
- Reference the relevant documentation section
- Avoid introducing speculative behavior
- Preserve backward compatibility where applicable
- Include clear rationale and scope description

---

## Review Philosophy

Protocol correctness and documentation alignment
take precedence over feature completeness or speed.
